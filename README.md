JAX-CPFEM: an efficient GPU-computing simulation for differentiable crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), built on top of [JAX-FEM](https://github.com/deepmodeling/jax-fem). Leveraging [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), this tool addresses the need for inverse design for smart manufacturing.
