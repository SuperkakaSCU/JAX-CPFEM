JAX-CPFEM: an efficient GPU-computing simulation for differentiable crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), built on top of [JAX-FEM](https://github.com/deepmodeling/jax-fem). Leveraging [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), this tool addresses the need for inverse design for smart manufacturing. 

## The concept of differentiable CPFEM
We want to emphasize the following three features that differential JAX-CPFEM from other CPFEM software:
- __GPU-acceleration__: Efficient solution to forward CPFEM (involving complicated nonlinear relations) with GPU acceleration based on array programming style and matrix formulation.
- __Automatic Constitutive Laws__: Free to realize different deformation mechanics represented by constitutive materials laws by evaluating the case-by-case Jacobian matrix using automatic differentiation.
- __Automatic Sensitivity__: Differential simulation for sensitivity analysis with respect to design parameters used in single crystal or polycrystal, which can be seamlessly integrated with inverse design.

## Applications
### Forward simulations

### Gradient-based calibration of CPFEM model parameters with AD‚Äêbased sensitivities

### Inverse Design via AD-based sensitivities


## Installation
JAX-CPFEM supports Linux and macOS, which depend on JAX-FEM.
### Install JAX-FEM
JAX-FEM is a collection of several numerical tools, including the Finite Element Method (FEM). See JAX-FEM installation [instructions](https://github.com/deepmodeling/jax-fem?tab=readme-ov-file). Depending on your hardware, you may install the CPU or GPU version of JAX. Both will work, while GPU version usually gives better performance.

### Install Neper
[Neper](https://neper.info/) is a free/open-source software package for polycrystal generation and meshing. It can be used to generate polycrystals with a wide variety of morphological properties. A good [instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9n756wFu4&list=PLct8iNZXls-BMU7aleWoSoxgD8OFFe48W&index=5) video is on Youtube.

### Install JAX-CPFEM
Place the downloaded file in the `applications/` folder of JAX-FEM, and then you can run it.

### Quick Tests
For example, you can download `polycrystal_304steel/` folder and place it in the `applications/` folder of JAX-FEM, run
```bash
python -m applications.polycrystal_304steel.polycrystal_304steel
```
from the root directory will run the CPFEM example of polycrystal 304 stainless steel. Use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for visualization.
