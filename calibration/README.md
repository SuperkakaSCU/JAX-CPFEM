## An efficient GPU-accelerated calibration of crystal plasticity model parameters by multi-objective gradient-based optimization with AD‚Äêbased sensitivities

On top of JAX-CPFEM package, the pipeline integrates AD-based sensitivity analysis with gradient-based optimization, offering a computationally efficient and accurate method for calibration.
